# Project Explanation: Apple Data Analysis using PySpark

## Project Overview

This project is an advanced data engineering task focused on building a scalable and maintainable ETL pipeline using PySpark within the Databricks environment. The primary objective is to analyze customer transactions related to Apple products and derive insights based on various business questions.

## Goals

### Databricks Environment

1. **Clusters**: Learn to create and manage clusters in Databricks.
2. **DBFS**: Understand how to use the Databricks File System to store and manage data files.
3. **File Uploads**: Learn to upload CSV and Parquet files to DBFS.
4. **Delta Tables**: Understand the creation and management of Delta tables for efficient querying.

### Low-Level Design (LLD)

1. **Factory Design Pattern**: Implement the factory pattern using abstract classes to create flexible ETL components.
2. **Abstract Classes**: Define abstract extractors, transformers, and loaders to ensure a clean, modular, and extendable codebase.

### Codebase Design

1. **Extractors**: Implement classes to read data from various file formats.
2. **Transformers**: Implement classes to apply business logic and data transformations.
3. **Loaders**: Implement classes to write transformed data back to various sinks, including DBFS and Delta tables.

### Apache Spark Concepts

1. **SparkSession**: Learn to initiate a Spark session and configure it for the project.
2. **File Formats**: Understand the difference between row and columnar file formats (CSV vs. Parquet vs. Delta).
3. **Joins**: Use broadcast joins for efficient data merging.
4. **Transformations**: Understand narrow vs. wide transformations and their impact on performance.
5. **Job Management**: Explore the Spark UI to monitor jobs, stages, and tasks.
6. **Optimization Techniques**: Learn techniques like predicate pushdown and predicate pruning for optimizing queries.

### Business Logic Implementation

1. **AirPods after iPhone**: Identify customers who bought AirPods after purchasing an iPhone.
2. **AirPods and iPhone**: Identify customers who bought both AirPods and iPhones.
3. **Product Sequence**: List all products purchased by customers after their first purchase.
4. **Average Time Delay**: Calculate the average time delay between buying an iPhone and AirPods.
5. **Top-Selling Products**: Identify the top 3 selling products in each category based on total revenue.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Databricks Setup

1. **Cluster Creation**: Start by creating a cluster in Databricks with the appropriate configurations for running PySpark jobs.
2. **File Uploads**: Use the Databricks interface to upload the required datasets (`customer.csv`, `products.csv`, `transactions.csv`) to DBFS.
3. **Delta Table Creation**: Convert the CSV data into Delta tables for efficient querying.

### Project Structure

1. **AppleAnalysisMainCode.py**: This is the main script that ties together the extractors, transformers, and loaders to execute the ETL pipelines.
2. **Reader_Factory.py**: Contains abstract classes and their implementations for reading data from CSV, Parquet, and Delta formats.
3. **Loader_Factory.py**: Contains abstract classes and their implementations for writing data to DBFS and Delta tables.
4. **Extractor.py**: Implements specific extractors for reading data required for the analysis.
5. **Transformer.py**: Implements various transformers that apply business logic to the extracted data.
6. **Loader.py**: Implements loaders that save the transformed data to specified locations.

### Running the Project

1. **In Databricks**: 
   - Use the `%run` magic command to run dependent notebooks from the main notebook.
   - Execute the main notebook to run the entire ETL pipeline.

2. **Locally with Databricks Community Edition**:
   - Follow the same steps as above.
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed locally (PySpark, Delta Lake).
   - Run the notebooks in sequence to execute the ETL pipelines.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building ETL pipelines using PySpark in a scalable and maintainable way. By leveraging the Databricks environment, it covers both theoretical and practical aspects of data engineering, focusing on real-world business problems. The outcome is a set of analytical insights that can drive decision-making in an enterprise context.
